      <p>It&rsquo;s been quite a while since my last post. I was busy with finishing up my degree and trying to get my foot in the door to cyber security.</p>
<p>At this point, if you&rsquo;re preparing for OSWE you&rsquo;ve probably read through tones of blogs already. With this blog I&rsquo;ve tried to keep it short and simple. I&rsquo;ll outline my approach towards cracking the exam and try to answer common questions I get, so that I can shamelessly direct anyone asking here.</p>
<p><code>Background</code></p>
<p>Prior to preparing for OSWE I had zero experience in code review and while I don&rsquo;t have any professional experience in development, I can quickly hack something up in PHP, Python or NodeJS if needed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not OSCP certified, and I didn&rsquo;t touch HTB for preparation.</p>
<p>I registered for the two-month course and took 300 hours over a span of 3 months, from pre-registration to taking the exam and passing on the first attempt.</p>
<p><code>Pre-Registration</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Be comfortable with common web vulnerabilities &amp; Burp Suite. The course is focused on web applications.</li>
<li>Know at least one languauge (preferably Python). You&rsquo;ll have to fully automate exploits to pass.</li>
<li>Have a basic understanding of MVC &amp; OOP concepts. You don&rsquo;t want to end up looking at an interface or abstract class and wonder why all the methods are empty.</li>
<li>Knowing your way around regex will help a lot, but you can pick this up as you go through the course, if you aren&rsquo;t familiar.</li>
</ul>
<p>The amount of content available online is somewhat overwhelming. I&rsquo;d narrowed down resources and skimmed over topics that I was already familiar with. Paired with the course material they provide excellent coverage:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://z-r0crypt.github.io/blog/2020/01/22/oswe/awae-preparation/">z-r0crypt&rsquo;s Blog</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wetw0rk/AWAE-PREP">Wetw0rk&rsquo;s Reources</a></li>
<li><a href="https://forum.hackthebox.com/t/oswe-exam-review-2020-notes-gifts-inside/2232">21y4d&rsquo;s Post</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hub.schellman.com/blog/oswe-review-and-exam-preparation-guide">Nathan Rague&rsquo;s post</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These blogs have great writeups with varying degrees of complexity:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/">Code White Sec</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.assetnote.io/">Assetnote</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/">Sonar Source</a></li>
</ul>
<p><code>Post Registration</code></p>
<p>For each application in the lab, I followed a simple strategy, spending a minimum of 30-45 minutes on each step even if I wasn&rsquo;t able to progress:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find out how request routing works in the application without referring to the material, regardless of whether it&rsquo;s covered or not. This includes being able to trace a function back to its route and vice versa.</li>
<li>Trying to find the vulnerability on my own once I feel that I have enough background knowledge on the vulnerability being covered.</li>
<li>Writing exploit scripts referring to the course material.</li>
</ol>
<p>This really helped me in fleshing out a concrete methodology that I could use when I actually have to do a code review for fun, in a project or in the exam.</p>
<p>With my lab time running out I didn&rsquo;t complete all the extra miles but was able to solve the majority of them. Instead, I wanted to focus on getting one mock exam done and selected two extra machines whose solutions aren&rsquo;t provided. I gave myself 48 hours and skipped reporting. This was important to test my methodology and refine it further for the actual exam. I found the exam boxes to be a bit trickier, but still doable.</p>
<p><code>The Exam</code></p>
<p>Being able to cover the extra miles will be really helpful in passing the exam and I&rsquo;d suggest doing as many as possible on your own.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep any scripts you&rsquo;ve written during the duration of the course handy to save time during the exam.</li>
<li>Take frequent breaks. I paced in my room for a few minutes after every hour and a half. Code review can be mentally taxing if you&rsquo;re new to it.</li>
<li>Make sure that you get a good amount of sleep. I ended up finding the last vulnerability too late because of a simple mistake I made when crafting payloads since I&rsquo;d slept for 3 hours on the second day. Fortunately, I had enough points to pass at this point.</li>
<li>Make sure you take screenshots of everything!</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Closing thoughts</code></p>
<p>While the course material is excellent, I needed some additional reading from online sources to get comfortable with some of the more complex topics. Anyone who&rsquo;s interested in getting started with secure code review will find this as a really good starting point, and you&rsquo;ll feel comfortable reviewing code in languages you may not be able to code in.</p>
